# Week 2

## Review
We worked on finetuning the model. We also compared results with the results of week with the previous weeks. This week was more intensive as we had little idea on finding the right datasets for the process. 

## Learnings
We worked on how to find datasets, and learned and finetuned the YOLOv11n model provided by ultralytics. This model was already proficient in detecting cars, but we found a data-set online and tried finetuning it using annotated images.
